# List Comprehension: are a concise way to create lists.
# They consist of brackets containing the expression, which is executed for each element, along with the for
#Example:



#?Two-Dimensional Lists
#
# 
#  

#Basic Math:
# 1. Addition: a + b
# 2. Subtraction: a - b
# 3. Multiplication: a * b
# 4. Division: a / b
# 5. Modulus: a % b
# 6. Floor Division: 2 // 6

#Variable Assignment:
# assign: = 
# add: +=
# subtract: -=
# multiply: *=
# Reassigning variables in python

#Object Types:
# type()
#int, float, str, list, tuple, boolean

#User Input:
#input()

#Comparison Operators:
#  ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
#  is, is not, in, not in
#  and, or, not

#Conditional Statements:
# if, elif, else

#For Loops and While Loops:
# for loops with iterables like: lists, strings, tuples
# while loops with conditions like: boolean values, comparisons
# 1. For Loops: iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or
# 2. While Loops: execute a block of code as long as a condition is true
# 3. Nested Loops: loops inside loops
# 4. Loop Control Statements: break, continue, pass
# For loops with useful functions: range()

#Functions
# 1. Defining a function: def function_name(parameters):
# 2. Calling a function: function_name(parameters)
# 3. Function arguments: positional, keyword, default, variable

#Lists:
# 1. Indexing: accessing elements by their position
# 2. Slicing: accessing a subset of elements
# 3. List Methods: append, insert, remove, sort, reverse, index, count
# 4. List Comprehensions: creating lists from other iterables
# 5. List Operations: concatenation, repetition, membership testing
# 6. List Iteration: iterating over lists using for loops or while loops
